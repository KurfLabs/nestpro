# What the original has that the rebuild doesn't (yet)

Full survey of the original's features: its three ribbons (jobs manager, nesting &
machining, part drawing), the helper programs it ships (DNC links, program importers,
technology tables…) and the behaviour recorded in MECHANICS.md.

**Have** = working in the rebuild · **Part** = a simpler version exists · **Missing**.
Priority: ★★★ needed for real daily laser work · ★★ valuable · ★ niche / other machine types.

The item-by-item to-do list (with IDs, estimates to check, and what agents can't reach yet)
is **`FEATURES.md`** at the top of the repo; keep both in step.

## Jobs manager (Home / Manage / Utilities / View)

| Original | Rebuild | Pri |
|---|---|---|
| Job Explorer, Product List, Product view, Sheet list, Sheet View | Have (Jobs screen) | |
| Save jobs to disk / database (New, Connect, Information) | Have — `.snjob` files and the Library (jobs and products on disk, a folder several PCs can share: every change under one write lock, MECHANICS LB1–LB3; `library-check` tests a shared folder from several PCs at once, LB4; a save over someone else's newer save asks first and takes nothing from stock, LB7–LB10; one job folder tree for every PC, with sub-folders, Cut and Paste, JX10–JX15, and one for library parts, each new part filed like its job, JX18–JX20; a Library that can't be reached is said so everywhere, naming its folder, and is never made by itself: a new one is made in Settings after asking, LB11–LB13; with auto-refresh on, the lists and open jobs show other PCs' saves within seconds, LB14–LB16; a job open on another PC is **in use**: held, shown, warned about, Take over, and not deleted, renamed or moved from under it, CU5–CU12); Lantek SQL database is read-only (Windows) | |
| Parts from database, Import parts (DXF/DWG/MEC/IGES/GEO…) | Have — DXF, DWG, Lantek MEC (encrypted too), IGES, PDF, ESSI, DSTV, GEO (`formats/`), picked in an import window with a preview of the drawing (IM10); still missing HPGL, ISO programs, ME10, EPS and others (JOB-26) | |
| Rectangles (quick rectangular parts) | Part — built-in shapes | |
| Sheets stock manager (sizes, quantities, remnants) | Have — Sheet stock window: list/criteria, quantities, priority, locking, create, what the open job uses; nesting takes sheets from stock (best sheet format / combination searches, time limit) | |
| **Materials** and **Consumables** (gas, nozzles) | Part — fixed material list (any thickness typed, in mm or inches: MECHANICS TH1), each with its machine-file key (Settings → Materials → Machine table); the machine file's material × thickness sections pick leads, joints, joint gap and offer gap/margins (MECHANICS MTL1–MTL12); no gas/nozzle keys | ★★ |
| Machine setup (several machines) | Part — several machines in Settings, each with what it does (laser, plasma, punch…) and its post (library, BLM, CT1); the Sheet tab picks the job's machine from them (MECHANICS MK1) | ★★ |
| Kits From Database, Kit Explorer | Missing | ★★ |
| Quotation (save quote, Quotation Jobs) | Missing | ★★ |
| Element Search (search jobs by type, name, date, status) | Part — simple search | ★ |
| Export / Import nestings, database backup | Part — program + CSV export | ★★ |
| Punches, turrets, multitools, dies, drills | Missing (punch machines) | ★ |
| Flex3D unfolding / bending, 3D importer (SolidWorks, Inventor…) | Missing | ★ |
| Duct parts module, Processes, Parametric editor | Missing (Part — 8 shapes with width/height) | ★ |
| Masterlink / Oseon ERP connectors | Different systems — the rebuild has its own ERP / MES link with a **Fulcrum** connector: Settings → ERP / MES + Jobs → ERP / MES (see below) | |

## Nesting screen — Home tab

| Original | Rebuild | Pri |
|---|---|---|
| Sheets: New, Delete (current / subjob / job), Previous/Next/Go to, Change quantity, Change data, Unblock | Part — a stock sheet or remnant on the current sheet (Sheet stock window), previous/next, clear sheets; agents also have New / Change / Delete sheet (`sheet-add`, `sheet-change`, `sheet-delete`) | ★★ |
| Sheet set-up: material, thickness, machine, sheet size, margin and gap | **Have** — the Sheet tab, one grid of named fields; its *Nest on* line says before nesting whether Nest all takes the stock first (with its sheets and remnants for the job) or this size, and why; the size list shows the stocked sizes (agents: `info` → `nest_on`). A size picked in that list, typed, or taken from the Sheet stock window is the one Nest all nests on from then on, the stock's sheets of it first (ST18); *Any size in stock* goes back. Stock from an ERP's inventory missing (STK-20) | ★★ |
| Nesting: Do All (on selected sheets / filling sheets), Active subjob, One Sheet (redo), Delete | Part — Nest all with 5 levels; **Nest sheet** re-nests the current sheet with only its own parts (RN1, also right-click the sheet in the Nesting Explorer); Do All on selected sheets missing | |

## Simulation, View and helpers

| Original | Rebuild | Pri |

| Pictures for the agent (sheet/part PNG or SVG, numbered elements) | Have | |
| Every ribbon command mapped to an operation, test-enforced (`nestpro ops --gui`) | Have | |
| Window notices when an agent changed the open job file: reloads it, or asks when both changed | Have (`filewatch.rs`, once a second) | |
| Each open job keeps its own file (Save no longer writes into the previous job's file) | Have | |
| Lantek import XML (`import-xml`, one job file per material and thickness) and BLM program set back into a job (`import-program`) | Have — same rules as the window (`engine/imports.rs`) | |
| ByStar Fiber laser job (`.bvc`) opened as an editable job, every nest as its sheet(s) (`import-program`; Open CNC program in the window) | Have — `bvc.rs`, MECHANICS BV1–BV20; what it doesn't carry over is FEATURES JOB-74 | |
| Lantek database browser for agents | Missing (`todo:` in GUI_MAP; needs a Lantek SQL Server connection, Windows) | ★ |
| Sheet stock / remnant stock operations | Have — `stock`, `stock-book` (with `refs=` for new remnants' names; changed remnant lines remake unused remnants), `sheet-add`, `sheet-change`, `sheet-delete`; `nest` takes from stock through the window's code, with the best sheet format / combination searches when the window's options are on (`engine/stockflow.rs`, MECHANICS SA1–SA6, BN6–BN8) | |
| Semi-automatic remnant and rotate/flip remnant sheet for agents | Missing (`todo:` in GUI_MAP) | ★ |
| True-shape nesting, automatic leads and micro-joints for agents | Have — `nest`, `leads` (default type: the machine's tables), `joints` (`every=`) run the window's code (`nest::nest_plan`, `engine::TechEdit`, `cnc::plan`); the joint size classes are the machine's (FEATURES TEC-9) | |

## What this means for the next steps

For day-to-day laser work the most valuable gaps are, in order:

1. ~~Saving jobs~~ — done (`.snjob` + Library).
2. ~~Sheet stock and remnants~~ — done (see MECHANICS.md "Sheet stock and remnants").
3. ~~True-shape nesting~~ — done (strip profiles, on stock sheets and inside remnant outlines too); free rotation angles still to do.
4. ~~Speeds per material~~ — done (the machine's technology table and time file; check them against
   the shop's own BLM files, FEATURES MAC-25). Still to do for the post-processor: postprocessor words.
5. **Common cut and bridges**, then **Simulation** and **reports/labels**.

Punching, bevel, duct and 3D unfolding are other products' work and can wait.

## ERP / MES integrations (the rebuild's own; MECHANICS "ERP / MES integrations")

| Feature | Rebuild | Pri |
|---|---|---|
| Integration layer: one `Connector` per system, shared settings page, window and job links | Have (`src/integrations/`, `src/erpui.rs`) | |
| **Fulcrum**: token (DPAPI on Windows), Test connection | Have | |
| Fulcrum: list work waiting to be nested (material + operation groups, search, filters) | Have | |
| Fulcrum: **the planner's work orders** — list them, open a step as a job, store the nest on it (the app makes none) | Have (MECHANICS F18, F22, F23) | |
| Fulcrum: **work stations** — operations and scheduled machines mapped to the app's machines; only their work listed | Have (MECHANICS F20, F21) | |
| Fulcrum: import job operations as a job (cut list, DXF download, units, material, thickness, quantities per order) | Have | |
| Fulcrum: send the nest back (work order, sheets × count, parts per sheet, quantity per job operation, unplaced parts) | Have — **not yet tried against the live API** | ★★★ |
| Fulcrum: sheet stock item matched automatically (material shape + sheet size) | Part — item number typed per job | ★★ |
| Fulcrum: report sheets cut / scrap back (completion tracking) | Missing | ★★ |
| Fulcrum: remnants as inventory | Missing (after the sheet stock manager) | ★ |
| Other systems (Masterlink, Oseon, others) | Missing — add a connector | ★ |
